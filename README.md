# About this specialization

This specialization is intended for students interested to learn Java testing, mocking, improving their Java code, developing test-first Java artifacts, and building quality Enterprise Applications. There are four courses in the Specialization. Each course takes two weeks and about 3-5 hours of study time each week. 

# Applied Learning Project

Students will utilize hands-on labs to experiment and then create their own coding and testing, with available step-by-step videos to help them along the way. Robust videos, activities, readings, and class discussions help students build and retain knowledge through the courses.
